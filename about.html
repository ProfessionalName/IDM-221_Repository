		<p>Hello, my name is Cristiano D'Angelo. I am a college student enrolled at Ursinus College who is currently participating in their Philly-X program to attend classes at Drexel, as well as work at an internship. I have chosen Drexel classes in subjects not offered at Ursinus College for example, Web Design. My internship is at the Drexel Game Lab where I am helping Professor Santiago Ontanon analyze data for one of their projects. </p>

		<br>

		<p>I am a computer science major who has worked with Java, C++, Python, and Unity C#. I also have experience using other software like GUTS, a Torchwood 2 game editor, and LaTeX, a document creator for math typesetting. The current language I am most comfortable with is Java but I am always interested broadening my horizons by learning new computer languages and concepts.</p>

		<br>

		<p>One of my favorite hobbies is the trading card game Magic the Gathering. I have been playing MTG for about eight years now. Magic the gathering is a game that is always evolving which is why I continue to enjoy it today. In addition to trading card games, I am also an avid video gamer. Some of my favorite games include Dark Souls, Super Smash Bros, and Overwatch. 
		</p>

		<br>
		
		<p>An interesting fact about me is that I was homeschooled. My family started homeschooling right after kindergarten and I continued to be homeschooled all the way through until high school. Being homeschooled has taught me a lot about being independent. I am well versed in figuring out how to do something by myself and I enjoy learning about new subjects. I like to think that being homeschooled is one of the reasons that I am who I am today.</p>
